# JenpyROQ
This repository implements an extended, modularised and streamlined version of the PyROQ code (see below for a detailed list of changes), forked in March 2022 from its [original repository](https://github.com/qihongcat/PyROQ) and developed at the Theoretisch-Physikalisches Institut of the Friedrich-Schiller-Universit√§t Jena. 

Older history is available in [this fork](https://github.com/bernuzzi/PyROQ/tree/master/PyROQ).
Please cite the [PyROQ paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13812) and the COMING SOON paper if you use this code in your research. 

# Installation and usage

Starting from the `JenpyROQ` location, 
the package can be installed using the command:

    python setup.py install

Once  `JenpyROQ` is  installed, it is possible to construct an ROQ approximant through a configuration file and running the main routine of the package:

    python -m JenpyROQ --config-file config.ini

The user can see the full list of options at:

    python -m JenpyROQ --help

A simple example can be run by:

    python -m JenpyROQ --config-file config_files/Test_configs/test_config_IMRPv2.ini

Other examples are available in the `config_files` directory, see the relative [README file](https://github.com/bernuzzi/PyROQ/blob/master/config_files/Test_configs/README.md).

## MPI parallelisation

Parallelisation options are described under the `[Parallel]` section of the help message.
For MPI-based parallelisation, the run command should additionally be modified as follows:
    
    mpiexec -n NTASKS python -m JenpyROQ --config-file config_files/Test_configs/test_config_IMRPv2.ini
    
Where `NTASKS` corresponds to the requested number of parallel tasks. 
Moreover, the config file should specify the related flag `parallel=2`  and `n-processes` should correspond to NTASKS.  


# Output

The run directory will automatically contain a copy of the configuration file, git information and the screen output, stored under `JenpyROQ.log`.

Preselection basis and related parameters, together with the enriched basis, its related parameters, the basis interpolant and empirical nodes are stored at each step of the enrichment loop under the `ROQ_data` directory.

Basis specifications needed to interface with parameter estimation codes are available under `ROQ_data/ROQ_metadata.txt`.

Several diagnostic plots (basis parameters, frequency nodes, outliers and error evolution, a single test waveform comparison and validation tests) are stored under the `Plots` directory.

# Algorithm and code description

The algorithm implements what described in the [PyROQ paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13812), but extended as to allow for a more flexible pre-basis construction (with user-defined inputs), an arbitrary number of enrichment cycles with arbitrary and variable tolerance thresholds.

The code also speeds up the execution by parallelising wherever possible, implements a more strict parameters and input/output management, a largely increased use of code modularisation, defines generic waveform structures capable of interfacing modern python-based models, including machine learning-based ones.

Additional models supported compared to the original version (which supports any waveform approximant implemented in `LALSimulation`) are: 

   * [`TEOBResumS`](https://bitbucket.org/eob_ihes/teobresums/src/master/README.md), a faithful semi-analytical model for compact objects on generic orbits;  
   * [`MLGW-BNS`](https://pypi.org/project/mlgw-bns/), an efficient machine learning version of the frequency-domain [`TEOBResumSPA`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00027) model; 
   * [`NRPMw`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09112), post-merger (including their hybridisation with EOB-inspirals) binary neutron star models, interfaced through [`bajes`](https://github.com/matteobreschi/bajes).

# Dependencies

The package depends on standard Python libraries, except for: `numpy` for numeric computation, `h5py` for data storing and `matplotlib` for plotting. Moreover, if MPI-based parallelisation is requested, the package has an additional dependency on `mpi4py`.
